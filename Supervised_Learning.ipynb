    "Machine Learning covers two main types of data analysis: **Unsupervised Learning** and **Supervised Learning**. In the former case we are dealing with problem of exploratory analysis where we have to discover structure and patterns within the data, while in the latter case we deal with a predective analysis problem. In all the dataset there is a set of variables that might be denoted as **input** which are measured or preset. These have come influence on one or more **output**. When the goal is to use the inputs to predict the values of the outputs we talk about supervised learning, that is the type of data analysis we want to focus on here. \n",
    "Once we made a very first split between the two main tasks machine learning addresses, and we decide to concentrate on supervised learning, another important split happened within supervised method depending of the type of variables involved. Before introducing this split it worth to give some more precise terminology about the type of variables in the game. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all we have used the more modern language of machine learning. In the statistical literature the inputs are often called the __predictors__, a term we will use interchangeably with inputs, and more classically the _independent variables_. In the pattern recognition literature the term _features_ is preferred, which we use as well. The outputs are called the _responses_, or classically the _dependent variables_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both input and outputs vary in nature and they can take values in basically 3 categories: **quantitative**, **qualitative** (or **categorical**), and a third type called **ordered categorical**. In the first case we have variables taking numerical continous values. In the second case the variables take values in a finite set or classe. The elements in a class can be both numerical (but finite, discrete) or simply qualitative (like red, blue, green). The last type refers to a categorical variable with a natural order (like, small, medium and large). \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we introduced the type of variables we can divide a supervised problem into two main classes depending on the type of the output variables. If we have to predict one or more quantitative output we talk about **Regression** while if the output variables is categorical we will deal with **Classification**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Inputs also vary in measurement type; we can have some of each of qualitative and quantitative input variables. These have also led to distinctions in the types of methods that are used for prediction task we chose depending on output variables: some methods are defined most naturally for quantitative inputs, some most naturally for qualitative and some for both.\n",
    "\n",
    "A little bit more of terminology involves the dataset terminology we use. We will typically denote the input variable dataset by a matrix $N\\times p$, $X$. We also label a $p$-vector (row) by $x_i$ with $i=1,\\cdots N$, running over all the observations. Instead, the columns $N$-vector, which in principle contains all the $N$ observation for a given features, it will be denoted by $x_j$, with $j=1,\\cdots, p$. \n",
    "The output vector will be denoted by $Y$ and the predicted values will always be labelled by $\\hat{Y}$, if the output takes values in $\\mathbb{R}$, so it's quantitative. If we are dealing with categorical output we will use the letter $G$ and the predcited value by $\\hat{G}$, taking values in the class $\\mathcal{G}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need data to construct prediction rules, often a lot of it. We thus suppose we have available a set of measurements $(x_i, y_i)$ or $(x_i, g_i)$, $i=1,\\cdots N$ , known as the __training dataset__, with which to construct our prediction rule. We will be provided also what we call a __test dataset__ that will be used to test our accuracy as we will see in the following. "

The test error of a learned classifier is related to the sum of the bias and the variance of the learning algorithm. Generally, there is a tradeoff between bias and variance.

A __Machine Learning Algorithm__ is the program used to learn a machine learning model from data. A __Machine Learning Model__ is the learned program that maps inputs to predictions. This can be a set of weights for a linear model or for a neural network.

When it comes to predictive modeling, you have to make a trade-off: Do you just want to know what is predicted? Or do you want to know why the prediction was made and possibly pay for the interpretability with a drop in predictive performance? In some cases, you do not care why a decision was made, it is enough to know that the predictive performance on a test dataset was good. But in other cases, knowing the ‘why’ can help you learn more about the problem, the data and the reason why a model might fail. Some models may not require explanations because they are used in a low-risk environment, meaning a mistake will not have serious consequences. The need for interpretability arises from an incompleteness in problem formalization (Doshi-Velez and Kim 2017), which means that for certain problems or tasks it is not enough to get the prediction. The model must also explain how it came to the prediction, because a correct prediction only partially solves your original problem. \n",

    "\n",
    "    The world has a lot of unreliable, disorganized and generally dirty data. You add a potential source of errors as you write preprocessing code. Given the frequency and potentially disastrous consequences of bugs, debugging is one of the most valuable skills in data science. Understanding the patterns a model is finding will help you identify when those are at odds with your knowledge of the real world, and this is typically the first step in tracking down bugs. Interpretability is a useful debugging tool also for detecting bias in machine learning models.\n",

    "\n",
    "    You have no control over datasets you download online. But many businesses and organizations using data science have opportunities to expand what types of data they collect. Collecting new types of data can be expensive or inconvenient, so they only want to do this if they know it will be worthwhile. Model-based insights give you a good understanding of the value of features you currently have, which will help you reason about what new values may be most helpful.\n",

    "\n",
    "To comprehend and interpret the whole model at once, we need __global__ interpretability. Global interpretability is all about being able to explain and understand model decisions based on conditional interactions between the dependent variables and the independent features on the complete dataset. Trying to understand feature interactions and importances is always a good step towards understanding global interpretation. Of course, visualizing features after more than two or three dimensions becomes quite difficult when trying to analyze interactions. Hence, often looking at modular parts and subsets of features, which might influence model predictions on a global knowledge, helps. Complete knowledge of the model structure, assumptions and constraints are needed for a global interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For __local__ interpretability, we do not care about the inherent structure or assumptions of a model and we treat it as a black box. For understanding prediction decisions for a single datapoint, we focus specifically on that datapoint and look at a local subregion in our feature space around that point, and try to understand model decisions for that point based on this local region. Local data distributions and feature spaces might behave completely different and give more accurate explanations as opposed to global interpretations. We can use a combination of global and local interpretations to explain model decisions for a group of instances.\n",

This can be coefficients, p-values, AIC scores pertaining to a regression model, rules from a decision tree and so on. Model-__agnostic__ tools are more relevant and can be used on any machine learning model. These agnostic methods usually operate by analyzing feature input and output pairs. By definition, these methods do not have access to any model internals like weights, constraints or assumptions.\n",

The concept is really straightforward: We measure the importance of a feature by calculating the increase in the model’s prediction error after permuting the feature. A feature is “important” if shuffling its values increases the model error, because in this case the model relied on the feature for the prediction. A feature is “unimportant” if shuffling its values leaves the model error unchanged, because in this case the model ignored the feature for the prediction.\n",
